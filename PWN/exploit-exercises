Nebula-->Protostar-->Fusion

Nebula
Nebula covers a variety of simple and intermediate challenges that cover Linux privilege escalation, 
common scripting language issues, and file system race conditions.

Nebula is an ideal place to get started for people new to Linux exploitation.

Protostar
Protostar introduces basic memory corruption issues such as buffer overflows, format strings and heap exploitation 
under “old-style” Linux system that does not have any form of modern exploit mitigiation systems enabled.

Protostar is the next progression from Nebula.

Fusion
Fusion continues the memory corruption, format strings and heap exploitation but this time focusing on 
more advanced scenarios and modern protection systems.

Fusion is the place to start if you are familiar with Linux exploitation and wish to learn more about exploitation prevention systems.



Main Sequence
Main Sequence is the Capture The Flag event from Ruxcon 2012. It provides a variety of challenges such as 
penetration tool usage, binary analysis, 
basic cryptographic analysis, client side exploitation, password cracking and general website hacking.

Cloud Road
Cloud Road is the Capture The Flag event from Ruxcon 2014. Play as an agent for the underground CloudRoad corporation. 
Compromise web applications, reverse engineer binaries, write exploits, decipher obfuscated messages, and more!
